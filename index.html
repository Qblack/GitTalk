						<h2>About the talk</h2>
						<p>This talk is is about git and how it can you can use it in your lives.</p>
						<p>I have tried to keep everything at a level where everyone can understand.</p>
						<p>Not everything I say will be considered by all to be the best or right way.</p>

						<h2>What is git?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Git is a distributed version control system</li>
							<li>Allows for multiple people to work on the same project for group work</li>
							<li>Allows you to commit changes to code so you can easily revert back</li>
							<li>Allows you to create features but not break existing code, through branches</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Git vs Github</h2>
						<p>git is the system Github is just a host. There are other hosts such as BitBucket and Stash.</p>

						<h2>How git works</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Keeps track of incremental changes to files and a their history</li>
							<li>Each repository is a mirror of the server</li>
							<li>If the server goes down it can be restored from any clone</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Why use git vs other VCS</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Git is distributed</li>
							<li>This means that you can work offline</li>
							<li>Git init will make a local repo that can be used locally and does not need to be hosted, useful for homework.</li>
							<li>You have a back up of your work online if you host it. (In case someone spills coffee on your computer)</li>

						<h1>How do I git?</h1>
						<h2>Git Installation</h2>
							<p><a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Grab Git</a><p>
							<p>This will install git on the command line. For Linux/Mac Users, git might be pre-installed with your OS already.</p>
							<p>To make sure that git is properly installed, fire up the command line and type in <code>git</code></p>
						<h2>Setting up a repo</h2>
							Two different ways to create a repo on your machine:
							<h3>Preexisting Directories</h3>
								<code> git init </code>
								Later a remote repository can be added with.
								<code> git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git</code>
							<h3>Cloning</h3>
								If you have a preexisting repository you can clone it with
								<code>git clone [url]</code>
								This will create a folder with the repo name and copy the git repository.
								e.g. <code>git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git</code>

							<h2>Git Commands</h2>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 slide">
							<div class="slide-content">
							<h3>Git Status</h3>
								<p>Checks the status of the repo.<br>
								Displays the current branch, and how it compares to the online version.<br></p>
								<code>git status</code>
								<img src="img/git_status.PNG" class="center-block img-responsive" alt="Git status example">
								<h5>Results divided into 3 sections:</h5>
								<dl>
									<dt>Changes to be committed</dt>
									<dd>these changes will be committed when <code>git commit</code> is used.</dd>
									<dt>Changes not staged for commit</dt>
									<dd>these are changes to files already registered with the repo, but need to be <code>git add</code>ed.</dd>
									<dt>Untracked files</dt>
									<dd>these are changes on files that are not yet tracked by the repo, they will also need to be added.</dd>

								</dl>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 slide">
							<div class="slide-content">
								<h3>Git Add</h3>
									<p>In order for git to track a file you must tell git to add it. This is done by</p>
									<code>git add [filename]</code>
									<p>Ensure that you want to track the file, compiled code, and extraneous files should be added to the .gitignore</p>
									<p>Other uses of <code>git add</code> include <code>git add -A</code> which will add all files</p>
									<p>When you start to get comfortable with git start tyring to use the wildcard <code>*</code> to add multiple files at once.
									The <code>-p</code> is also incredibly powerful but not for the faint of heart.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 slide">
							<div class="slide-content">
								<h3>Git Commit</h3>
									<p>Once you have added a file you must make a commit. Commits are basically groups of changes
									a developer makes and have a message describing what they are. It is good practice to make your commits
									small and logical. This can help you in the future.</p>
									<p>To create a commit use:</p>
									<code>git commit -m "[message]"</code>
									<p>If you use <code>git commit -am "[message]"</code>All modified tracked files will be added.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 slide">
							<div class="slide-content">
								<h3>Git Push</h3>
									<p>Once you have made your commits and are ready to share them with the world you need to push. Note:
									There may be issues if someone has pushed before you so be sure to follow the instructions provided,
									usually a <code>git pull</code>.</p>
									<p>When using command line I usually find it best to only push the branch I am working on, to do so use</p>
									<code>git push origin [branch name]</code>
									<p>Git push may prompt you for your username and password so be sure to provide the correct pair.</p>
									<p>Once pushed you can now go to your host and see your changes.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 slide">
							<div class="slide-content">
								<h3>Git Pull</h3>
									<p>Once your code is on the repo the other contributors can <code>git pull</code>
										your changes and make their own edits. I tend to do one branch at a time.</p>
									<code>git pull origin [branchName]</code>
									<p>Git pull may produce merge errors which are covered later.</p>
									<p>If the pull is successful then you will see a diff log of all the files changed
										and the number or additions or deletions.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 slide">
							<div class="slide-content">
								<h3>Git Branch</h3>
									<p>Branching is very important in git. You usually want to keep your master stable so branches allow
									for the developer to add features with out breaking everyone else's work or are easily able to go back
										to where they were before.</p>
									<p>To create a new branch use:</p>
									<code>git branch [branchName]</code>
									<p>Once created you will need to use <code>git checkout</code> to switch to the branch.</p>
									<p>The branch command has other uses as well.</p>
									<code>git branch</code>
									<p>Will list all branches that your local machine is aware of, you are able to checkout branches not on this list.</p>

									<p>Once a branch is merged into master and you are done with it, it is good practice to delete it with
									<code>git branch -d [branchName].</code></p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 slide">
							<div class="slide-content">
								<h3 >Git Checkout</h3>
									<p>In order to start using your branch run:</p>
									<code>git checkout [branchName]</code>
									<p><code>Git checkout</code> and <code>git branch</code> can be combined by using
										<code>git checkout -b [branchName]</code>. This will make and checkout the branch.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 slide">
							<div class="slide-content">
								<h3 >Git Merge</h3>
									<p>When a branch is ready for production or to be combined with another branch you run:</p>
									<code>git merge [sourceBranchName]</code>
									<p>This command tells git to merge the two branches and their files together and determine what
										should be kept and what discarded.</p>
									<p>Merge conflicts may occur when doing this and need to be resolved before the merge commit is ready.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 slide">
							<div class="slide-content">
								<h3>Git Stash</h3>
									<p>A useful is not abused command is</p>
									<code>git stash</code>
									<p>This will put your changes in a stack. The changes can either be ignored or brought back later.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 slide">
							<div class="slide-content">
								<h3>Git Diff</h3>
									<p>In order to look at the changes that have been made to unstaged changes you can use</p>
									<code>git diff</code>
									<p>This will show you a list of additions and deletions that have been made.<code>q</code> to exit.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 slide">
								<div class="slide-content">
								<h3>Git Rm</h3>
									<p>To remove files from the index use <code>git rm [filename]</code></p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12 slide">
							<div class="slide-content">
								<h3>Git Mv</h3>
									<p>To rename files or move them use <code>git mv [source] [destination]</code>.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

						<h2>Merging</h2>
						<p>If your commits are structured wrong you may end up with merge conflicts.
							Multiple developers changing the same line of code may cause this, so if possible try to work in different areas.</p>
								<img src="img/its-dangerous-to-go-alone-take-this.jpg" class="center-block img-responsive" height="50%" width="50%">
						<p>Merges may be scary but there are tools to help. My personal favorite is
							<a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/">Kdiff3</a></p>
						<p>KDiff will allow you to go through each conflict and either choose the change you want or edit the changes
							until you are happy. Once complete save and exit, git will now be able to finish its merge.</p>
						<p>If you want to setup Kdiff3 as your default merge tool run the following commands to modify your .gitconfig</p>
	<pre>git config --global merge.tool kdiff3
	git config --global mergetool.kdiff3.keepBackup false
	git config --global mergetool.kdiff3.path "C:\Program Files\KDiff3\kdiff3.exe"</pre>
						<p>To use the merge tool use <code>git mergetool</code> then use the UI to resolve any issues.</p>
					<p>If there are orig or back up files feel free to delete them or just add them to your .gitignore</p>

						<h2>Git Workflow</h2>
						<p>There are several different workflows that people use for git based upon their environment.</p>
						<p>Some best practices I have picked up over the years are:</p>
						<h3>Single Dev</h3>
							<p>Until deploy I do most of my stuff on master branching off for specific features that will
							affect the rest of my project.</p>
							<p>Once Deployed, I tend to have  test branch to ensure that anything merged from my feature
							or topic branches works before pushing to master.</p>
						<h3>Small group project</h3>
							<p>Master should remain stable, and developers should work on their own feature branches.</p>
						<h3>Bigger or more official groups</h3>
							<p>It is a good idea for larger groups to have developers perform pull requests.
							The person of charge of handling pull requests will then review the changes, and provide
							feed back before the changes will be allowed into the reop.</p>

						<h2>The Files</h2>
							<p>Git has several files associated with it.</p>
						<dl>
							<dt>.gitconfig</dt>
							<dd>Usually in your C:\Users\User folder. This file contains any global settings you want git to use.</dd>

							<dt>Repo specific .git/config</dt>
							<dd>The .git folder keeps track of the git settings for that repo locally. Such as the origin url,
							and the current branch.</dd>
							<dt>.gitignore</dt>
							<dd>The git ignore files use wild cards and regex to determine what files you want git to ignore.</dd>
						</dl>

						<h2><a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a></h2>

						<p>Github is a hosting platform for git repos, users get unlimited public repos.</p>
						<p>On github you can <b>fork</b> other repos which essentially makes a copy of the repo on your page.
						This allows you to make changes and then do pull requests if you want to share them.</p>
						<p>Repos are also entitled to site <a href="https://pages.github.com/">pages</a> which can be used to
							run the page.</p>
