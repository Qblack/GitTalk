					<h2>What is git?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Git is a distributed version control system</li>
						<li>Allows for multiple people to work on the same project for group work</li>
						<li>Allows you to commit changes to code so you can easily revert back</li>
						<li>Allows you to create features but not break existing code, through branches</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Git vs Github</h2>
					<p>git is the system Github is just a host. There are other hosts such as BitBucket and Stash.</p>
				</div>

					<h2>How git works</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Keeps track of incremental changes to files and a their history</li>
						<li>Each repository is a mirror of the server</li>
						<li>If the server goes down it can be restored from any clone</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Why use git vs other VCS</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Git is distributed</li>
						<li>This means that you can work offline</li>
						<li>Git init will make a local repo that can be used locally and does not need to be hosted, useful for homework.</li>
						<li>You have a back up of your work online if you host it. (In case someone spills coffee on your computer)</li>

					<h1>How do I git?</h1>

					<h2>Setting up a repo</h2>
					Two different ways to create a repo on your machine:
					<h4>Preexisting Directories</h4>
					<pre> git init </pre>
					Later a remote repository can be added with.
					<pre> git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git</pre>
					<h4>Cloning</h4>

					If you have a preexisting repository you can clone it with
					<pre>git clone [url]</pre>
					This will create a folder with the repo name and copy the git repository.

					<h2>Git Commands</h2>

					<h4>Git Status</h4>
						<p>Checks the status of the repo.<br>
						Displays the current branch, and how it compares to the online version.<br></p>
						<pre>git status</pre>
						<img src="img/git_status.PNG" alt="Git status example">

						<h5>Results divided into 3 sections:</h5>
						<b>Changes to be committed</b> these changes will be committed when <code>git commit</code> is used.<br>
						<b>Changes not staged for commit</b> these are changes to files already registered with the repo, but need to be <code>git add</code>ed.<br>
						<b>Untracked files</b> these are changes on files that are not yet tracked by the repo, they will also need to be added.<br>

					<h4>Git Add</h4>
						<p>In order for git to track a file you must tell git to add it. This is done by</p>
						<pre>git add [filename]</pre>
						<p>Ensure that you want to track the file, compiled code, and extraneous files should be added to the .gitignore</p>
						<p>Other uses of <code>git add</code> include <code>git add -A</code> which will add all files</p>
						<p>When you start to get comfortable with git start tyring to use the wildcard <code>*</code> to add multiple files at once.
						The <code>-p</code> is also incredibly powerful but not for the faint of heart.</p>


					<h4>Git Commit</h4>
						<p>Once you have added a file you must make a commit. Commits are basically groups of changes
						a developer makes and have a message describing what they are. It is good practice to make your commits
						small and logical. This can help you in the future.</p>
						<p>To create a commit use:</p>
						<pre>git commit -m "[message]"</pre>
						<p>If you use <code>git commit -am "[message]"</code>All modified tracked files will be added.</p>

					<h4>Git Push</h4>
						<p>Once you have made your commits and are ready to share them with the world you need to push. Note:
						There may be issues if someone has pushed before you so be sure to follow the instructions provided,
						usually a <code>git pull</code>.</p>

						<p>When using command line I usually find it best to only push the branch I am working on, to do so use</p>
						<pre>git push origin [branch name]</pre>
						<p>Git push may prompt you for your username and password so be sure to provide the correct pair.</p>
						<p>Once pushed you can now go to your host and see your changes.</p>


					<h4>Git Pull</h4>
						<p>Once your code is on the repo the other contributors can <code>git pull</code>
							your changes and make their own edits. I tend to do one branch at a time.</p>
						<pre>git pull origin [branchName]</pre>
						<p>Git pull may produce merge errors which are covered later.</p>
						<p>If the pull is successful then you will see a diff log of all the files changed
							and the number or additions or deletions.</p>

					<h4>Git Branch</h4>
						<p>Branching is very important in git. You usually want to keep your master stable so branches allow
						for the developer to add features with out breaking everyone else's work or are easily able to go back
							to where they were before.</p>
						<p>To create a new branch use:</p>
						<pre>git branch [branchName]</pre>
						<p>Once created you will need to use <code>git checkout</code> to switch to the branch.</p>
						<p>The branch command has other uses as well.</p>
						<pre>git branch</pre>
						<p>Will list all branches that your local machine is aware of, you are able to checkout branches not on this list.</p>

						<p>Once a branch is merged into master and you are done with it, it is good practice to delete it with
						<code>git branch -d [branchName].</code></p>

					<h4>Git Checkout</h4>
						<p>In order to start using your branch run:</p>
						<pre>git checkout [branchName]</pre>
						<p><code>Git checkout</code> and <code>git branch</code> can be combined by using
							<code>git checkout -b [branchName]</code>. This will make and checkout the branch.</p>

					<h4>Git Merge</h4>
						<p>When a branch is ready for production or to be combined with another branch you run:</p>
						<pre>git merge [sourceBranchName]</pre>
						<p>This command tells git to merge the two branches and their files together and determine what
							should be kept and what discarded.</p>
						<p>Merge conflicts may occur when doing this and need to be resolved before the merge commit is ready.</p>

					<h4>Git Stash</h4>
						<p>A useful is not abused command is</p>
						<pre>git stash</pre>
						<p>This will put your changes in a stack. The changes can either be ignored or brought back later.</p>

					<h4>Git Diff</h4>
						<p>In order to look at the changes that have been made to unstaged changes you can use</p>
						<pre>git diff</pre>
						<p>This will show you a list of additions and deletions that have been made.<code>q</code> to exit.</p>

					<h4>Git Rm</h4>
						<p>To remove files from the index use <code>git rm [filename]</code></p>
					<h4>Git Mv</h4>
						<p>To rename files or move them use <code>git mv [source] [destination]</code>.</p>

					<h2>Merging</h2>
					<p>If your commits are structured wrong you may end up with merge conflicts.
						Multiple developers changing the same line of code may cause this, so if possible try to work in different areas.</p>
							<img src="img/its-dangerous-to-go-alone-take-this.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
					<p>Merges may be scary but there are tools to help. My personal favorite is
						<a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/">Kdiff3</a></p>
					<p>KDiff will allow you to go through each conflict and either choose the change you want or edit the changes
						until you are happy. Once complete save and exit, git will now be able to finish its merge.</p>
					<p>If you want to setup Kdiff3 as your default merge tool run the following commands to modify your .gitconfig</p>
<pre>git config --global merge.tool kdiff3
git config --global mergetool.kdiff3.keepBackup false
git config --global mergetool.kdiff3.path "C:\Program Files\KDiff3\kdiff3.exe"</pre>
					<p>To use the merge tool use <code>git mergetool</code> then use the UI to resolve any issues.</p>
